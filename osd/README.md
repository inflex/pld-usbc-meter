# PLD USB C Meter
Simple USB C current/voltage meter that can be placed on a lead powering a device

# Requirements

Currently needs an INA219 current/voltage sensor on i2c and a i2c-usb bridge.

For now this is purely a prototype development but I have placed the code on github
so that I can keep track of it.

Assume EVERYTHING is wrong here.

You will require the SDL2 development lib in linux


# Setup

	(linux) make
